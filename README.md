# netbox-devices  
This my public store for my Netbox device templates.  
So if you seems something you need, feel free to import.  
1. check if the vendor is created already  
- if not, you can create them with the vendor.csv
2. Import the devices that you need.  
(may I also create a "all $Vendor devices" import or "import all" later)  
  
**Please Note**  
I will not change my naming convention how you like them.  
If I need to edit them to fit my needs, I just do it.  
May I publish a second version to have both versions.  

**Issues**  
Issues are more of a to do list for me, so I may not accept your wishes.  
  
**Disclamer**
